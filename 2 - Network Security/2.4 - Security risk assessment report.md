## Scenario

You are a **security analyst** working for a social media organization. The organization recently experienced a **major data breach**, which compromised the safety of their customers' personal information, such as names and addresses. Your organization wants to implement strong **network hardening practices** that can be performed consistently to prevent attacks and breaches in the future. 

After inspecting the organization's network, you discover four major vulnerabilities:

1. The organization's employees' share passwords.
2. The admin password for the database is set to the default.
3. The firewalls do not have rules in place to filter traffic coming in and out of the network.
4. Multifactor authentication (MFA) is not used. 

If no action is taken to address these vulnerabilities, the organization is at risk of experiencing another data breach or other attacks in the future. 

In this activity, you will write a security risk assessment to analyze the incident and explain what methods can be used to further secure the network.

## Respond

### Part 1: Select up to three hardening tools and methods to implement

1. **Implementing multi-factor authentication (MFA)**
   - MFA requires users to use multiple ways to identify and verify their credentials before accessing an application.
   - Authentication factors may include:
     - Something you are: fingerprint and retina scans, facial recognition
     - Something you have/possess: ID cards and phone numbers or devices
     - Something you know: PINs and passwords

2. **Enforcing strong password policies**
   - Requires employees to follow rules regarding:
     - Password strength
     - Combination of text, numbers, and symbols
     - Discouraging password sharing
   - Set up a prompt that locks user access to the network after three unsuccessful attempts

3. **Performing firewall maintenance regularly and port filtering**
   - Regular firewall maintenance to check and update security configurations for threat detection
   - Implement port filtering to block specific port numbers and limit unwanted communication

### Part 2: Explain your recommendations

1. **Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)**
   - Reduces the likelihood of malicious actors accessing the network
   - Protects against "Brute Force Attack" and related attack methods
   - Promotes secure identity access to the network

2. **Strong Password Policies**
   - Strengthens the company's defenses against hackers attempting to breach the network
   - Addresses the vulnerability of password sharing and weak default passwords

3. **Firewall Maintenance and Port Filtering**
   - Enables detection of suspicious incoming and outgoing traffic
   - Requires regular monitoring by the administrator
   - Protects against various DoS and DDoS attacks
   - Port filtering controls network traffic and prevents attackers from entering the private network
