# SIEM - Splunk

## Introduction

**Splunk** is a powerful platform that helps organizations prevent major issues, identify threats, restore services, and accelerate transformation by providing crucial visibility and insights.

> SIEM tools, like Splunk, collect and process data, transforming it into searchable events that can be queried, viewed, and analyzed.

## Overview

Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems, such as Splunk, are essential tools for security analysts. They provide a platform for:

- Storing data from various sources
- Analyzing complex datasets
- Generating comprehensive reports

Splunk utilizes its own querying language called **Search Processing Language (SPL)**, which includes:
- Use of pipes
- Wildcards
- Efficient search capabilities for identifying patterns, trends, and anomalies within data

## Scenario

As a security analyst at Buttercup Games (an e-commerce store), you're tasked with identifying potential security issues with the mail server. Specifically, you need to explore failed SSH logins for the root account.

### Data Sources

The provided dataset includes information from the following servers:

- `mailsv`: Buttercup Games' mail server (primary focus for this analysis)
- `www1`, `www2`, `www3`: Buttercup Games' web applications
- `vendor_sales`: Information about Buttercup Games' retail sales

## Objectives

- Upload sample log data
- Search through indexed data
- Evaluate search results
- Identify different data sources
- Locate failed SSH login(s) for the root account

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Data Upload

1. Log in to Splunk
2. Navigate to "Add Data" on the Splunk bar
3. Upload the `tutorialdata.zip` file

### 2. Basic Search

1. Go to the "Search and Reporting" tab
2. In the search bar, enter: `index=main`
3. Set the time range to "All time" to view all events

> **Tip**: Adjust the time range as needed. A shorter range returns results faster and uses fewer resources.

### 3. Understanding Common Components

Splunk uses three primary components to categorize data:

1. **Host**: Specifies the device or system that generated the event
   ![Host Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alanslzrr/cybersecurity-lab/main/assets/7.2C.png)

2. **Source**: Indicates the original location of the event data within a specific device or system

3. **Sourcetype**: Defines the format and structure of the event data, guiding Splunk on how to parse and interpret the information

### 4. Analyzing Mail Server Data

1. To explore events generated by the mail server, use the search query:
   ```
   index=main host=mailsv
   ```
   This will list over 9,000 events from the mail server.

### 5. Identifying Failed Root Logins

1. To search for failed logins for the root account, use the query:
   ```
   index=main host=mailsv fail* root
   ```
   - `fail*` expands the search to include terms like "failure", "failed", etc.
   - `root` searches for any event containing this term

## Key Findings

Based on the analysis:

1. The main index contains over 100,000 events across all time.
2. The `host` field specifies the name of the system from which an event originates.
3. The `vendor_sales` host provides information about Buttercup Games' retail sales, including product sales numbers.
4. As of February 11th, 2024, there have been **346 failed SSH logins** for the root account on the mail server.

This analysis demonstrates the power of Splunk in quickly identifying potential security issues, such as repeated failed login attempts, which could indicate a brute force attack or other security concerns.
