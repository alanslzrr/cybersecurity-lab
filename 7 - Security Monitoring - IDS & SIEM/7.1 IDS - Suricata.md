# Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) - Suricata

## Introduction

**Suricata** is an open-source security tool that functions as an:
- Intrusion Detection System (IDS)
- Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)
- Network Analysis Tool

An **Intrusion Detection System (IDS)** is a application that monitors system activity and alerts on possible intrusions, helping organizations identify indications of malicious activity within their systems and networks.

## Suricata's Functionality

Suricata can be utilized in three primary ways:

1. **Intrusion Detection System (IDS)**
   - Monitors network traffic
   - Alerts on suspicious activities and intrusions
   - Can function as a host-based IDS to monitor system and network activities of a single host

2. **Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)**
   - Detects and blocks malicious activity and traffic
   - Requires additional configuration, including enabling IPS mode

3. **Network Security Monitoring (NSM)**
   - Produces and saves relevant network logs
   - Useful for forensics, incident response, and signature testing
   - Can process:
     - Live network traffic
     - Existing packet capture files
     - Full or conditional packet captures

## Signature Analysis

Suricata employs **signature analysis**, a detection method to identify events of interest. Signatures consist of three components:

1. **Action**
   - Describes the action to take if network or system activity matches the signature
   - Examples: alert, pass, drop, or reject

2. **Header**
   - Includes network traffic information such as:
     - Source and destination IP addresses
     - Source and destination ports
     - Protocol
     - Traffic direction

3. **Rule Options**
   - Provides various options to customize signatures

## Practical Application: Examining Alerts, Logs, and Rules

As a security analyst monitoring network traffic, you'll configure Suricata and use it to trigger alerts. This process involves:

1. Exploring custom rules in Suricata
2. Running Suricata with a custom rule to trigger it
3. Examining output logs in the `fast.log` file
4. Analyzing additional output in the standard `eve.json` log file

### Key Files

1. **`sample.pcap`**
   - Packet capture file containing example network traffic data
   - Used to test Suricata rules

2. **`custom.rules`**
   - Contains custom rules
   - Rules are added to this file and run against the `sample.pcap` file

3. **`fast.log`**
   - Contains alerts generated by Suricata
   - Located in `/var/log/suricata` directory after Suricata runs
   - Considered deprecated but useful for quick checks and quality assurance

4. **`eve.json`**
   - Main, standard, and default log for Suricata-generated events
   - Contains detailed information about triggered alerts and other network telemetry events
   - Uses JSON format
   - Generated when Suricata runs
   - Located in `/var/log/suricata` directory

### Testing Process

When creating a new rule:
1. Test the rule to confirm its functionality
2. Use the `fast.log` file to compare the number of alerts generated
3. Run Suricata to test the signature against the `sample.pcap` file

## Expected Outcomes

By the end of this exercise, you should be able to:

- Create and run custom rules in Suricata
- Monitor traffic captured in a packet capture file
- Examine and interpret the `fast.log` and `eve.json` output files

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Examine a Custom Rule in Suricata

Let's analyze the following custom rule:

```
alert http $HOME_NET any -> $EXTERNAL_NET any (msg:"GET on wire"; flow:established,to_server; content:"GET"; http_method; sid:12345; rev:3;)
```

![Custom Rule Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alanslzrr/cybersecurity-lab/main/assets/7.1B.png)

#### Rule Breakdown:

- **Action**: 
  - `alert`: Instructs to alert on selected network traffic. The IDS will inspect traffic packets and send an alert if it matches.

- **Header**:
  - `http`: The rule applies only to HTTP traffic.
  - `$HOME_NET any -> $EXTERNAL_NET any`: Indicates the direction of traffic from $HOME_NET to $EXTERNAL_NET.
    - Note: $HOME_NET is a Suricata variable defined in `/etc/suricata/suricata.yaml` as the `172.21.224.0/20` subnet.

- **Rule Options**:
  - `msg:"GET on wire"`: The alert will print out this text.
  - `flow:established,to_server`: Determines that packets from the client to the server should be matched (after the SYN-ACK handshake).
  - `content:"GET"`: Instructs Suricata to look for the word "GET" in the `http.method` of the packet.
  - `sid:12345`: Unique numerical value that identifies the rule.
  - `rev:3`: Indicates the signature's version.

### 2. Trigger a Custom Rule in Suricata

a. First, list the files in the `/var/log/suricata` folder:
   ```
   ls -l /var/log/suricata
   ```
   Initially, this folder should be empty.

b. Run Suricata using the `custom.rules` and `sample.pcap`:
   ```
   sudo suricata -r sample.pcap -S custom.rules -k none
   ```
   - `-r sample.pcap`: Specifies the input file to mimic network traffic.
   - `-S custom.rules`: Instructs Suricata to use the rules defined in the `custom.rules` file.
   - `-k none`: Disables all checksum checks.

c. List the files in the `/var/log/suricata` folder again:
   ```
   ls -l /var/log/suricata
   ```

d. Display the contents of `fast.log`:
   ```
   cat /var/log/suricata/fast.log
   ```

   ![Fast Log Contents](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alanslzrr/cybersecurity-lab/main/assets/7.1G.png)

   Each line corresponds to an alert generated by Suricata when it processes a packet that meets the conditions of an alert-generating rule. The lines include the triggered rule, source, destination, and direction of the traffic.

### 3. Examine `eve.json` Output

a. Display the entries in the `eve.json` file:
   ```
   cat /var/log/suricata/eve.json
   ```
   The data will be in JSON format.

   ![Eve JSON Raw Output](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alanslzrr/cybersecurity-lab/main/assets/7.1H.png)

b. Display the entries in an improved format:
   ```
   jq . /var/log/suricata/eve.json | less
   ```

   ![Eve JSON Formatted Output](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alanslzrr/cybersecurity-lab/main/assets/7.1I.png)

c. Extract specific event data from the `eve.json` file:
   ```
   jq -c "[.timestamp,.flow_id,.alert.signature,.proto,.dest_ip]" /var/log/suricata/eve.json
   ```

   ![Extracted Event Data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alanslzrr/cybersecurity-lab/main/assets/7.1J.png)

   > Note: Press Q to exit the `less` command and return to the command-line prompt.

### 4. Key Findings in `eve.json`

After examining the `eve.json` file, we can observe the following:

- The severity value for the first alert returned by the `jq` command is **3**.
- The destination IP address listed for the last event in the `eve.json` file is **142.250.1.102**.
- The alert signature for the first entry in the `eve.json` is **"GET on WIRE"**.

These findings demonstrate the detailed information Suricata provides in its logs, allowing for in-depth analysis of network traffic and potential security threats.
