# SIEM - Chronicle

## Introduction

**Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)** is an application that collects and analyzes log data to monitor critical activities in an organization.

**Chronicle** is a cloud-based SIEM service, built as a specialized layer on top of core Google infrastructure. It's designed for enterprises to privately retain, analyze, and search massive amounts of security and network telemetry.

## Overview of Chronicle

Chronicle offers two primary search types:

1. **Unified Data Mode (UDM)** - Default search type
   - Searches security data that has been ingested, parsed, and normalized
   - Faster retrieval due to indexed and structured data

2. **Raw Log Search**
   - Searches through raw, unparsed logs
   - Slower than UDM, but allows for more specific queries
   - Supports regular expressions for pattern matching

Key Features:
- **Search Field**: Used to search for specific events
- **Procedural Filtering**: Applies filters to refine search results
- **YARA-L**: A computer language used to create rules for searching through ingested log data

## Case Study: Phishing Email Investigation

### Scenario

As a security analyst at a financial services company, you're investigating a potential phishing attack. An employee received a suspicious email containing the domain `signin.office365x24.com`. Your task is to determine if other employees received similar emails or accessed this domain.

### Objectives

1. Access threat intelligence reports on the domain
2. Identify assets that accessed the domain
3. Evaluate HTTP events associated with the domain
4. Identify which assets submitted login information to the domain
5. Identify additional related domains

### Investigation Process

#### 1. Launch Chronicle and Perform Domain Search

Search for `signin.office365x24.com` in Chronicle's search bar.

#### 2. Evaluate Search Results

| Component | Description | Findings |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| VT Context | VirusTotal information | 7 security vendors flagged this domain as malicious |
| WHOIS | Domain registration information | First/last seen: 7 months ago (as of Feb 10, 2024) |
| Prevalence | Historical access graph | Domain accessed on July 9, 2023 and Feb 10, 2024 |
| Resolved IP | IP addresses associated with the domain | `104.215.148.63` & `40.100.174.34` |
| Sibling Domains | Related domains | `login.office365x24.com` |
| ET Intelligence Rep List | Proofpoint's Emerging Threats info | Category: Drop site for logs or stolen credentials<br>Confidence: 22/127<br>Severity: Medium<br>Active: Dec 31, 2018 - Jan 8, 2019 |
| Timeline | Event history | Reveals GET and POST HTTP requests |
| Assets | Systems that accessed the domain | 6 assets identified |

#### 3. Key Findings

1. **Domain Classification**: `signin.office365x24.com` is categorized as a "Drop site for logs or stolen credentials" by ET Intelligence.

2. **Affected Assets**: Six assets accessed the suspicious domain:
   - ashton-davidson-pc
   - bruce-monroe-pc
   - coral-alvarez-pc
   - emil-palmer-pc
   - jude-reyes-pc
   - roger-spence-pc

3. **IP Addresses**: Two IP addresses map to `signin.office365x24.com`:
   - 104.215.148.63
   - 40.100.174.34

4. **Additional Domain**: The IP `40.100.174.34` also resolves to `signin.accounts-google.com`, potentially indicating a wider phishing campaign.

5. **Suspicious Activity**: Three POST requests were made to `40.100.174.34`.

6. **Potential Data Exfiltration**: POST requests to `http://signin.office365x24.com/login.php` suggest possible credential harvesting.

### Conclusion

The investigation reveals a sophisticated phishing campaign targeting multiple employees. The use of domains mimicking legitimate services (Office 365 and Google) indicates a well-planned attack. Immediate action is required to:

1. Isolate affected systems
2. Reset credentials for compromised accounts
3. Enhance email filtering to block the identified malicious domains
4. Conduct organization-wide security awareness training

This case study demonstrates the power of Chronicle in quickly identifying and analyzing potential security threats across an organization's network.
