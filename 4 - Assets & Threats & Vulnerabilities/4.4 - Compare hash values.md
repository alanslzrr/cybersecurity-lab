# Compare Hash Values

## Description

As a **security analyst**, one of the security controls we can implement is **hashing**. It produces a code that cannot be decrypted. It works by uniquely identifying the contents of a file, later known as a **unique identifier** (hash value or digest). For example, a malicious program may mimic an original program. If one code line is different from the original program, it produces a different hash value. Security teams can then identify the malicious program and work to mitigate the risk.

## Generate Hashes

1. First, the `ls` command shows the files within the directory. 
2. We have two files and we would like to show the contents of them using the `cat` command. 
3. We could see from the picture below that the contents of both files appear to be identical.

We can find if the files are really different or not by using the `sha256` command. From the picture below we can see both files have different hash values.

## Compare Hashes Files

Let's generate the hash of the `file1.txt` and `file2.txt` to new files named `file1hash` and `file2hash` respectively.

Inspect the contents of them by using `cat` commands. Last but not least, compare both files by using the `cmp` command.

## Summary

Though the contents of both files appear to be identical, only **hash values** of each file can determine if they are truly the same or not. This demonstrates the importance of hashing in identifying potential discrepancies or malicious alterations in files that may appear identical at first glance.
