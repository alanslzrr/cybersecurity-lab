# Parking Lot USB Drive Incident

## Scenario

You are part of the security team at **Rhetorical Hospital** and arrive to work one morning. On the ground of the parking lot, you find a **USB stick** with the hospital's logo printed on it. There's no one else around who might have dropped it, so you decide to pick it up out of curiosity.

You bring the USB drive back to your office where the team has **virtualization software** installed on a workstation. Virtualization software can be used for this very purpose because it's one of the only ways to safely investigate an unfamiliar USB stick. The software works by running a simulated instance of the computer on the same workstation. This simulation isn't connected to other files or networks, so the USB drive can't affect other systems if it happens to be infected with malicious software.

**Jorge's drive** contains a mix of personal and work-related files. For example, it contains folders that appear to store family and pet photos. There is also a new hire letter and an employee shift schedule. The flash drive appears to contain a mixture of personal and work-related files. Consider how an attacker might use this information if they obtained it. Also, consider whether this whole event was staged.

## Solution

| Points | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Contents** | Not all documents contain personal information. However, Jorge would not want them to be made public anyway. Some of the work files include personal information and details about the hospital's operations. |
| **Attacker mindset** | The information that the attackers would obtain could benefit them to trick Jorge. Now, they can send malicious emails to manipulate Jorge to obtain more personal information (payment cards and more). |
| **Risk analysis** | 1. **Managerial control**: Educate all employees about these types of attacks to raise awareness and prevent the incident from happening again. <br><br> 2. **Operational control**: Set up a protection system, such as installing antivirus and scanning devices on a regular basis. <br><br> 3. **Technical control**: To prevent malicious code from being executed when a USB drive is plugged in, disable the "autoplay" feature or ensure that files have to be sent through an email address with antivirus protection. |

## Recommendations

1. **Employee Training**: Implement regular cybersecurity awareness training sessions for all employees, focusing on the risks associated with portable storage devices and proper handling of sensitive information.

2. **USB Security Policy**: Develop and enforce a strict policy regarding the use of personal USB drives for work-related purposes. Consider providing encrypted, company-issued USB drives for necessary file transfers.

3. **Endpoint Protection**: Ensure all workstations have up-to-date antivirus software and endpoint protection solutions that can detect and prevent threats from removable media.

4. **Data Loss Prevention (DLP)**: Implement DLP solutions to monitor and control the transfer of sensitive data to external devices or cloud storage.

5. **Incident Response Plan**: Update the hospital's incident response plan to include specific procedures for handling potentially compromised removable media.

6. **Physical Security**: Enhance physical security measures in the parking lot and other areas where sensitive items might be lost or planted.

7. **Regular Audits**: Conduct regular audits of employee compliance with USB and data handling policies.
