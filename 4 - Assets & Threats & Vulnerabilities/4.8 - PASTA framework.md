# PASTA Model Framework Analysis

## Scenario

You're part of the growing security team at a company for sneaker enthusiasts and collectors. The business is preparing to launch a mobile app that makes it easy for their customers to buy and sell shoes. You are performing a threat model of the application using the **PASTA** framework (Process of Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis).

## Components of PASTA

1. Define Business and Security Objectives
2. Define the Technical Scope
3. Decompose Application (Data flow diagram)
4. Threat analysis
5. Vulnerability analysis
6. Attack modeling (Attack tree)
7. Risk analysis and impact

## Implementation

### 1. Define Business and Security Objectives

| Business Objectives | Security Objectives |
|---------------------|---------------------|
| Process transactions | One account, one payment method |
| Users can create profiles | Protected by passwords and Multi-Factor Authentication |
| Accept multiple payment methods | The app should be in compliance with PCI-DSS |
| Database utilization | Provide multi-factor authentication |

#### Context Diagram:

| Users | Admins |
|-------|--------|
| Add sneakers to cart | Store & update catalogs |
| Pay for products/service | Issue invoice |
| Send inquiry | Answer inquiry |

### 2. Define the Technical Scope

- API to connect the exchange of data between customers, employees and customers
- Public key infrastructure (PKI)
- SHA-256 (Hash functions to protect sensitive data)
- SQL

### 3. Decompose Application

### 4. Threat Analysis

- SQL Injection
- Session Hijacking
- Denial-of-service
- Denial of service, integration issues, service disruptions

### 5. Vulnerability Analysis

- Lack of prepared statements (parameterized query)
- Weak credential logins
- Overloaded app server
- Broken API Token

### 6. Attack Modeling

### 7. Risk Analysis and Impact

- SHA-256 Hashing
- Incident response procedures
- Playbook (security policy)
- Password policy
- Principle of least privilege
- Zero-trust

## Recommendations

1. **SQL Injection Prevention**: Implement robust input validation and parameterized queries.
2. **Session Management**: Enhance with secure, randomly generated session tokens and proper timeout mechanisms.
3. **DoS Mitigation**: Deploy a Web Application Firewall (WAF) and implement rate limiting.
4. **API Security**: Regularly audit and update, including proper token management and encryption.
5. **Security Training**: Conduct regular sessions for developers and administrators.
6. **Continuous Monitoring**: Implement logging to detect and respond to potential security incidents quickly.
7. **Regular Testing**: Perform penetration testing and vulnerability assessments to identify and address new security gaps.

By following this PASTA analysis and implementing the recommended security measures, the sneaker enthusiast company can significantly improve the security posture of their new mobile app, protecting both their business interests and their customers' data.
