# üõ°Ô∏è Cybersecurity Investigation and Risk Assessment

## üìå Project Overview

This project, inspired by the Datacom cybersecurity virtual job simulation via [Forage](https://www.theforage.com/simulations/datacom/cybersecurity-zm6d), presents two crucial scenarios in the field of cybersecurity:

1. Investigation of an Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) group
2. Comprehensive risk assessment for a client

## üïµÔ∏è Scenario 1: APT Investigation

### Background

A leading tech corporation client has fallen victim to a sophisticated cyberattack by APT34, a notorious Advanced Persistent Threat group. As a cybersecurity consultant at XYZ, your task is to conduct initial research on APT34 and assess the breach's impact.

### Objectives

- Research APT34's history, affiliations, and tactics
- Evaluate the potential impact on the client's information security
- Produce a comprehensive report with findings and recommendations

### APT34 Investigation Findings

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| History | Active since 2014, also known as OilRig or HelixKitten |
| Nation/State Association | Iranian government, possibly part of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) |
| Target Industries | Energy, finance, telecommunications, government agencies (Middle East and USA) |
| Motives | Espionage, intellectual property theft, financial data and government secrets acquisition |
| Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) | - Spear-phishing<br>- Social engineering<br>- Malware delivery (custom malware, POWRUNNER backdoor)<br>- Password spraying<br>- Persistent network presence |

### Recommended Security Measures

1. **Employee Training**: Educate staff on cyber threats and prevention
2. **Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)**: Implement to protect against credential theft
3. **Endpoint Protection**: Deploy anti-virus and anti-malware solutions
4. **Network Segmentation**: Limit potential spread of malware
5. **Incident Response Plan**: Develop and implement for quick threat response

## üîç Scenario 2: Risk Assessment

### Background

Following the APT investigation, a comprehensive risk assessment is required for the client. The client has basic physical security measures but is concerned about potential vulnerabilities in their information systems.

### Objectives

- Identify, evaluate, and prioritize potential security threats and vulnerabilities
- Determine risk levels and develop mitigation plans
- Provide a detailed risk assessment report with recommendations

### Risk Assessment Process

1. **Asset Identification**: Determine critical assets requiring protection
2. **Risk Matrix Definition**: Establish a framework for risk evaluation
3. **Risk Scenario Identification**: Outline potential threat scenarios
4. **Risk Rating Assessment**: Evaluate risks with and without existing measures
5. **Report Generation**: Summarize findings and provide mitigation recommendations

### Key Considerations

- Ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information systems
- Protect client reputation and financial resources
- Comply with regulatory and legal requirements
- Prioritize and implement appropriate security measures
